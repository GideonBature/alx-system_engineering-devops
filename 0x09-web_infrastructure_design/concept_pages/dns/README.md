Basics

DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP:

### The root domain and sub domain - differences

A root domain is the parent domain to a sub domain, and its name is not, and can not be divided by a dot.

While creating any domain at a website of domain provider, the provider system will always ask you to choose a domain name without a dot in the name. In other words, the address of the root domain may be **mydomain.com** but it can never be **my.domain.com**. Domain providers block the ability to create such a root domain until you type a name without the dot. Why?

The dot in the domain name delimits the sub domain name (the part of the name before the dot, eg. **www.my.**) and the root domain name ( the part after the dot, ie **.domain.com**). This means that the address **my.domain.com** is a sub domain of the root domain, whose name is **domain.com**

In an administrator panel at domain provider account, you can create any number of sub domains. This means that for the root domain called **domain.com** it is possible to create different sub domains eg. **my.domain.com**, **your.domain.com**, **school.domain.com**… Creating multiple sub domains is always free and does not require you to set up new accounts on a domain provider website.

As you can see, all of the domain addresses used as an example (above) do not start with the **www** prefix. **www** is also a sub domain. The www prefix always leads to the main domain.
